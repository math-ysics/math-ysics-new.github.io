            Welcome to my personal blog! Some of the content you'll encounter here might be a bit unconventional, so I kindly encourage you not to take it too seriously. I have a lot of thoughts saved up in various docs, so it'll take a while to transfer it all here!

          <h2 className="text-4xl mb-8">Entry #7. Why I don't watch movies.</h2>
          <div className="prose prose-lg dark:prose-invert mx-auto">
            <p>
              Throughout my entire life, I've possessed a keen sense, if one may call it that, of "correctness". Perhaps it's more effectively conveyed through 正解 and 不正解. When a movie is riddled with numerous logical fallacies, it becomes physically uncomfortable for me to watch; when I see something I find cringe, I develop an overwhelmingly strong urge to shy away. This discomfort often manifests itself in me pulling up an olympiad test to look at instead (it feels reassuringly logical and is calming). On a related note, in general, if I feel uncomfortable in public (very rarely), I tend to pull up a National Science Bowl round on YouTube; it provides the same calming effect, along with a peculiar sense of order. Interestingly, my best friend shares a similar habit with the National Spelling Bee or Geography Bee.

              I naturally gravitate towards certain spellings over others—statistically, these tend to be words I first came across aurally rather than visually. Particularly, "defence" and "sizeable" immediately come to mind. Beyond spelling, I strongly prefer the variation "'[word]'," over "'[word,]'"; the placement of the comma within the quotation marks, when not present in the original text, feels logically unjustifiable.

            <p>
              Very simply put, the seriousness of oneself determines the outcomes of one's efforts. If one wishes to improve in subject <em>x</em>, one must take <em>x</em> with supreme seriousness. One should search internally, whether by introspection or by other means, to reach the level of conviction to motivate and commit oneself to maintain this seriousness. Consequently, I find it challenging to tolerate frivolousness—it's vulgar.

          <div className="prose prose-lg dark:prose-invert mx-auto">
            <p>
              The general idea is that the Fermi paradox arises due to a few constraining factors in the Drake equation (one could modify the equation to enhance its comprehensiveness). Nevertheless, it is a near certainty that there exist numerous intelligent civilizations scattered throughout the observable universe (our separation by immense distances renders interaction an arduous endeavor).

              It's quite amusing that this entry violates the title to the last entry, but I consider it a topic strictly necessary to write about on a blog I call my own. It's notable to me that FSX was the first game I played (at the age of four), and it significantly contributed to my understanding of the world. Among the myriad things I realized, one of my favorites came in the form of geodesics, as in cross-ocean flights traced along great circles. I hold FSX's influence in high regard: it played a significant role as an unlikely yet invaluable foundation for critical thinking and a deep curiosity for the intricate workings of the world around me. It also ignited a passion for aviation that still burns today.

              I find it a matter of scarce interest, and thus I refrain from its mention unless it is strictly pertinent to some circumstance that warrants it.

              This is not an orphic chain of thought, but rather a more objective standpoint on how I view life. I perceive existence as deterministic, and thus nihilism beckons to me with its elegant indifference. This philosophy grants me absolute freedom, a gift I deeply cherish.

              Imagine life as a black box—offering no explicit purpose or inherent design from the outside, yet governed by an internal logic that transforms inputs into inevitable outcomes. Even so, its very existence bestows radical agency over how you choose to engage with it. It is a void—not barren, not desolate, but profound in its refusal to impose meaning, leaving you the sovereign architect of significance, or the liberator who discards it altogether. Within this, you may discover smaller boxes inside—your own constructions—values, aspirations, emotions. You can open and rearrange them or relinquish them at will, knowing they have never been, nor will they ever be, part of the black box's original essence. The black box is the utmost gift of gifts—one that is most beautiful because it is inherently unadorned.
